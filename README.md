# Surrogate

_This repository has been deprecated and merged with an internal nginx proxy. https://surrogate.hackedu.us remains online, just not with this code._

---

We've run into the issue where some schools block APIs that our workshops use
(like Twilio). Surrogate is our way of making those workshops work.

Surrogate is an HTTP proxy that we use to bypass school networks in our
workshops.
